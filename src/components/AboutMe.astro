      My name is Luis, I am 19 years old, and I am from Puerto Varas, Chile ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡±. I am currently studying Computer Engineering at Duoc UC, where I have been part of the <strong>Innovation and Technology Transfer Center (CITT)</strong> since 2023. At CITT, I am working on two projects: <strong>Duckietown</strong> and <strong> <a href='https://ecocashback.cl' target='_blank'> EcoCashBack</a> </strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      Since the beginning of my career, I have been studying and practicing various areas of development, including cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and more, with the aim of gaining knowledge in different areas of programming.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a Computer Engineering student, I have had the opportunity to participate in various competitions, such as the <strong>HACKATON EY-CITT <em>2023</em></strong> and <strong>Duckietown <em>2024</em></strong>.
